A friend of mine asked me to create a website for his [lawn mowing Winnipeg](https://www.cleanrmow.com) business. I could put this together using Wordpress, but I'm very curious about trying Rails, as I heard a lot of great things about it.

There are a lot of things to learn, it's not easy, but it's a great challenge and I hope I can make it. I'm on a PC, I noticed a lot of differences between Rails on a PC and Rails on a Mac, however there are so many tutorials out there that it's impossible not to succeed if you take the time to learn how to do it properly.

So I'm going to start right now and hopefully come back and share some of the things I learned in the process. Cheers.
